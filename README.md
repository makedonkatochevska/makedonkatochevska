With my 2+ years of experience in Website Design and Development, I combine the art of design with the science of coding to create websites that are not only visually striking but also intuitive and functional. With an eye for detail and a heart full of passion I pour my soul into every project to ensure it not only meets but exceeds expectations.
⚡ Fun fact:  I’m a perfectionist at heart—I want everything to be perfectly done! I have a checklist for just about everything, which helps me stay organized and on top of my tasks.
