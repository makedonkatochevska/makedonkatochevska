With my 2+ years of experience in Website Design and Development, I combine the art of design with the science of coding to create websites that are not only visually striking but also intuitive and functional. With an eye for detail and a heart full of passion I pour my soul into every project to ensure it not only meets but exceeds expectations.

Skills: HTML / CSS / SASS
